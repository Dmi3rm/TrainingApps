#netservices
This is ASP.NET MVC application, written while I was learning the technology. It has some usual CMS functionality like forum, news feed 
and admin panel. Unfortunatelly, I lost the database (restoring may take about 2 hours but there is no ne—Åessary, because the project will 
never be revived).
